Because BKV oncogenic properties, investigated whether may cause human cancer. Basic principles tumor virology imply BKV-induced tumors contain BKV DNA sequences. Therefore, assayed (by molecular hybridization) DNA human tumors malignant cell lines BKV DNA, using BKV [(32)P]DNA probe. The BKV [(32)P]DNA labeled vitro (nick translation) specific activities 1 2 x 10(8) cpm/mug. The BKV DNA used prepare probes properties expected authentic BKV genomes, including density superhelical DNA, sedimentation velocity alkaline neutral sucrose gradients, production one fragment endonuclease EcoRI cleavage four fragments endonuclease Hin II + III cleavage reassociation properties. From studies conclude BKV probes hybridized well, represented bona fide BKV DNA. Using three different BKV [(32)P]DNA probes, i.e., three distinct plaque isolates, analyzed DNA BKV-transformed cells, normal human tissues, large number human tumors. All human DNAs (cell lines, normal tissues, tumors) hybridized 5% BKV DNA. Hybridization analysis BKV-transformed hamster cell DNA indicated 5-6 copies least 88% BKV genome per cell. No BKV DNA sequences detected (above normal 5% hybridization human DNAs) following normal human tissues: 10 kidney (BKV usually isolated urine), 3 spleen, 13 lung, 23 colon, 2 rectum, 1 ileum, 1 skin. No BKV-specific DNA found 166 tumors, including 5 carcinomas (Ca) stomach, 3 Ca small intestine, 26 Ca colon, 9 Ca rectum, 31 Ca lung, 9 adenocarcinomas 5 oat cell carcinomas lung, 17 melanomas, 5 Ca prostate, 4 Ca bladder, 6 Wilms tumors, 4 hypernephromas, 15 Ca kidney, 7 brain tumors, 5 Hodgkin lymphomas, 10 lymphomas (immunosuppressed patients high incidence lymphomas), 2 reticulum cell sarcomas (spleen), 3 skin tumors. We also analyzed 7 human malignant cell lines (melanoma, lung, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastomas), including several clones lung melanoma line; BKV DNA sequences detected. Because probes could detect one copy BKV DNA 10% cells tumor cells, results strong evidence tumors analyzed BKV etiology.

To determine whether differences exist molecular mechanisms driving colorectal cancer Japanese Western, characterized Japanese patients colorectal cancer assessing genetic alterations involved cancer progression response treatment. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 254 Japanese diagnosed colorectal cancer institution 1994 2009. Mutations KRAS codons 12 13 BRAF codon 600 identified direct sequencing. Microsatellite instability (MSI) status determined genotyping 5 loci. Associations KRAS BRAF mutation clinicopathological characteristics prognosis evaluated. Results: KRAS BRAF mutation detected 33.5% 6.7% patients, respectively. KRAS mutation correlated poor recurrence free survival (RFS) (p = 0.03), especially stage II patients (p = 0.007). BRAF mutation significantly correlated anatomical site tumor (p < 0.001), tumor grade (p = 0.001) high frequency microsatellite instability (p < 0.001). BRAF mutation also correlated poor overall survival cases patients (p = 0.009). Overall, background KRAS BRAF mutation almost similar CRCs Western countries Japanese. However, KRAS mutation status considered helpful predict recurrence Japanese patients stage II CRC. Conclusions: Our findings indicate BRAF K-RAS mutation plays important role tumorigenesis colorectal cancer. These results indicate molecular analysis BRAF K-RAS may useful biomarker identifying patients right-sided colon cancer poor outcome may benefit individualized course therapy. 18690 Background: ALK+ NSCLC represents molecular target-defined patient population highly responsive ALK inhibitor crizotinib.

However, patients (pts) mutation showed similar clinical benefits EGFR-TKIs. Heterogeneity tumor cells considered one plausible reason. MuEGFR usually genotyped qualitative manner present clinical practice. In addition, new technology AQUA system enables us measure protein levels objectively considering expression heterogeneity tissues. Here investigated correlation AQUA score obtained specimen response response duration EGFR-TKIs. Methods: Slice sections genotyped 105 pts muEGFR 33 pts wild-type EGFR stained E746-A750 deletion (6B6)- L858R (43B2)-specific antibodies. Homo- heterogeneous staining muEGFR protein levels specimens evaluated AQUA system. Results: Concordance rate genotypes AQUA-based phenotypes (deletion L858R), cut-off values based ROC curve, 60% 82%. Low sensitivity 6B6 due lucking reactivity deletion variants. Alternatively, specificities antibodies 96% 92%, indicating highly selectivity muEGFR protein. The AQUA score 27 pts treated EGFR-TKIs varied (8.7 907.4) falls plot analysis indicated pts high AQUA score showed better objective response. Specimens partial response (PR) significantly higher AQUA score progression disease (136.5 vs 9.8, p=0.014). When divided pts two groups based median AQUA score, pts high AQUA score showed tendency longer treatment duration (21 mo vs 14 mo, p=0.162). These results indicate AQUA-based analysis classify pts carrying genotyped muEGFR susceptible less susceptible ones EGFR-TKIs. Conclusions: We observed pts high AQUA score sensitive EGFR-TKIs. It important predicting sensitivity EGFR-TKIs investigate genotyping also muEGFR protein levels using AQUA system. 18705 Background: The mutually exclusive pattern major targetable driver oncogenes lung adenocarcinomas (ADC) suggests similar driver oncogenes may exist.

Among patients colorectal cancer metastases, KRAS BRAF important biomarkers, role patients undergoing surgical therapy liver metastases unknown. In study, prevalence prognostic significance KRAS BRAF mutations determined patients undergoing surgical therapy colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Methods: KRAS BRAF analysis performed 202 patients undergoing curative intent surgical therapy CRLM 2003 2008. Tumor samples analyzed somatic mutations using sequencing analysis (KRAS: codon 12/13, BRAF: V600E). The frequency mutations ascertained impact outcome determined relative clinicopathologic factors. Results: KRAS gene mutations detected 58/202 patients (29%) undergoing surgery CRLM, comparable reported non-surgical patient series. In contrast, mutation BRAF gene identified low frequency surgical cohort, found 4/202 (2%) patients. KRAS mutations associated worse long-term survival (HR=2.13, CI=1.25-3.65), well risk recurrence (HR=1.89, CI=1.12-3.19). ). In addition, KRAS mutation also associated risk recurrence following surgical therapy (HR=1.89, CI=1.12-3.19).While clinicopathologic features, including tumor number, CEA primary stage also associated survival, KRAS status remained independently predictive outcome. The low incidence BRAF mutation limited ability determine prognostic impact. Conclusions: While KRAS mutations found approximately one third patients, BRAF mutations found 2% patients undergoing surgery CRLM. KRAS status independent predictor overall disease-free survival. Molecular biomarkers KRAS may help refine prognostic assessment patients undergoing surgical therapy CRLM. 18707 Background: The aim study evaluate efficacy safety combination carboplatin paclitaxel neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) patients affected locally advanced cervical cancer.

Patients germline BRCA1/2-mutations favorable prognoses non-BRCA carriers, recent work suggests BRCA2 carriers better BRCA1. We hypothesized concurrent proliferation pathway aberrations BRCA1/2 mutations tumors might play role patient outcome. Methods: Mutation, copy number, clinical data 309 TCGA-profiled serous ovarian tumors downloaded MSKCC cBIO web portal. Each tumor scored aberrant pathway gene (RB: RB1, CDKN2A, CCND1, CCND2, E2F3, CCNE1; PI3K: PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, AKT2; RAS: KRAS, BRAF, NF1) pathway mutated, amplified, deleted. Results: 205 309 tumors aberration least one pathways. The frequency pathway alteration differed significantly BRCA1 (82%, 28/34), BRCA2 (52%, 17/33) BRCA1/2 WT (66%, 160/242) tumors (BRCA1 vs. BRCA2: Fishers p= 0.0096). BRCA1 tumors frequently contained alterations multiple pathways BRCA2 WT tumors (41% vs. 24% 25%, respectively). RB-E2F pathway alteration frequency significantly different (BRCA1: 56%, BRCA2: 18%, WT: 43%, p=0.0043), significant differences PI3K RAS pathway aberration frequencies (BRCA1%: 41, 38; BRCA2%: 36, 27; WT% 28, 27), respectively, observed. In agreement previous report, BRCA2 patients significantly better overall survival (OS) either BRCA1 WT patients (median OS months BRCA1: 35.9, BRCA2 45.4, BRCA1/2 WT 27.8; p=0.001). Presence pathway alterations significantly associated OS BRCA1, BRCA2, WT patients cohort. Conclusions: These results show negative association BRCA2 mutations aberrations key proliferation survival pathways.
